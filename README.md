## Description
In the FEND, we have to make a clone of the classic Arcade Game named FROGGER. The User has to move the char from the grass over the road and into the water. Its important to avoid the bugs that travel on the road. If the User collides the char with a bug, the char is reset back at the beginning. Upon reaching the water, you get one Point to sucess and reset back to the starting Point

## How to Play

- Try to avoid a collision with the cockroaches and jump into the water.

- If you reached the water, you get an Point and you can play again. If you collide with a cockroach, you loose the point!
